## Ideas 
1. Create a questionnaire form that would be offered to community members. Here we'd collect more info of the members.
2. Create a google sheets / form where everyone's tech stacks would be. So we could know how to help each other. 
3. Having challenges such as #100DaysOfCode. We could instead start off with doing it in small manageable chunks. This would make it easier for people to start. This would help instill a habit of doing something small daily that would move them towards their goals. With this we would also need to have a reward system, like techie of the month. This provides opportunities for potential recruiters to recognize talent.
4. Starting off with a WhatsApp group >> WhatsApp community >> Discord. Whenever we reach a limit to each versions members we would move to the next version to the community. We could preferably divide the admin roles among each other, to WhatsApp roles and Discord. We could also delve into Tech Twitter, expanding our horizons. 
5. Create merchandise, stickers, shirts, wristbands etc ( This would require us to have out own logo designs. Preferably 3 of them, for different applications and better branding ) This would help generate income that would help fund more activities within the community. 
6. Create a website. This would ease the members' to get and connect with mentors. This would also help visualize what people's skills. Technical and soft ones. A blog would be integrated. This would help with user engagement and share knowledge. We'd also list tech events here, to increase awareness. 
#### Culture 
We could build the community on certain culture. This would help with enforcing principals that people would apply in their lives. 

We need to also help members with mental health activities. Activities that would make them productive and whole-sum. This is needed since most technological skills need one to perform cognitively at their best. This makes it easier for them to absorb information, retain and share it. 

#### Vision
- Help each other grow together. No matter one's skill level, each person has something they could share someone else needs. 
	NB:
	- Here, activities such as sharing info and debugging would be expected.
- Uplift each other to progress in our careers irrespective of the discipline. 
- Moving toward the same goals, pulling each other like train wagons. This analogy illustrates support. 
- Comforting each other and forming friendships. Facing challenges together and uplifting each other.
- Make professional connections, helping each other get opportunities to help them earn more.
	Example: Internships, Apprenticeship, Job opportunities, Hackathons
